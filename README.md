## NextBlue

NextBlue is a [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) theme modified from the popular [NexT](https://theme-next.org/) theme. The name is after the theme color, but of course you can choose any theme color you want other than the default blue color.

### Features
NextBlue is compatible with all the NexT settings, but in addition you are able to config:

- Choose a theme color
- Add a banner image
- Use icons from Iconfont as social icons (useful when you cannot find suitable icons in Font Awesome)
- Add link to the author name in the sidebar
- Display "powered by" and "theme by" information in the sidebar

Besides, there is a new tag `wp` you can use to easily link to Wikipedia articles.

### Installation

- Clone the theme from Github:
```
cd hexo
$ git clone https://github.com/stevenliuyi/hexo-theme-next-blue themes/next-blue
```

- Set theme in main hexo config file `_config.yml`:
```
theme: next-blue
```
