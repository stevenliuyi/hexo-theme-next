## NextBlue

NextBlue is a [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) theme modified from the popular [NexT](https://theme-next.org/) theme. The name is after the theme color, but of course you can choose any theme color you want other than the default blue color.

NextBlue is compatible with all the NexT settings, but in addition you are able to config:

- Choose a theme color
- Add a banner image
- Use icons from Iconfont as social icons (useful when you cannot find suitable icons in Font Awesome)

### Installation

- Clone the theme from Github:
```
cd hexo
$ git clone https://github.com/stevenliuyi/hexo-theme-next-blue themes/next-blue
```

- Set theme in main hexo config file `_config.yml`:
```
theme: next-blue
```
